## 🎨 Outside of Code

When I’m not writing code, you’ll probably find me:
- 📸 Doing street photography or chasing golden hour light
- 🌮 Sharing tacos or coffee with good friends
- 🥾 Hiking trails (especially if there's a good view at the end)
- 🛣️ Hitting the road for a spontaneous trip
- 🕹️ Playing Fallout or diving into cozy games

I’m passionate about accessibility, inclusive tech, and creating things that make life better for the people around me.
