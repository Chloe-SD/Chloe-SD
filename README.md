## 🎨 Outside of Code

When I’m not writing code, you'll find me chasing golden hour light with my camera 📸, sharing tacos with good friends 🌮, or getting lost in cozy games after debugging complex algorithms.

I'm passionate about accessibility, inclusive tech, and creating software that makes life better for everyone.

**Currently seeking full-stack developer roles** where I can build impactful software with mission-driven teams.

*Always happy to chat about tech, collaborate on projects, or grab coffee! ☕*
